# TFT, an EmulationStation theme made for small screens

This is very much a work in progress =)

I am building a portable and wanted to take a shot a creating a theme that fits the size of a TFT screen (specifically 320x240 resolution)

Design wise I am going for a layout that gives a small glimpse of the game selected and removes all other metadata to keep the views light.

## Details
- *This theme will only work on the latest version of retropie/ES with z-index support*
- Designed and tested at 320x240 resolution 
- Support for system, basic, detailed and video views
- Detail view works best with game screenshots (please scrape screenshots instead of boxart to get the look seen in the image above)
- If using on a pi1/zero please scrape game screenshots only (I have found videos only play smoothly on pi2/3)
- A matching splashscreen is included in the \_inc/images folder

## Acknowledgments
- Thank you to @jdrassa for fixing an issue in ES that allowed this layout to be possible
- All controller graphics are from the default Carbon theme made by Eric Hettervik (see: https://github.com/RetroPie/es-theme-carbon/)
- anthonycaccese from who I forked this entire project to adapt it to our new handheld console.

## Possible Future Updates
- UXS profiles to streamline scraping
- Update a few graphics to fit our RetroKAI's Game Gear ZERO.
